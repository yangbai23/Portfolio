            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Yang, and I'm a passionate developer with a unique background in auditing.</p>
            <p>For the past four years, I worked as an auditor, where I developed strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a problem-solving mindset. However, throughout my time in the field, I always felt a deep interest in technology and coding.</p>
            <p>Driven by my curiosity and passion for tech, I seized the opportunity to pursue a career in software development. I recently completed an intensive bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience with a variety of technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, TypeScript, Python, and SQL. My journey into the world of coding has been incredibly rewarding, and I‘m excited to apply my technical skills to solve real-world problems.</p>
            <p>I believe my background in auditing has equipped me with a unique perspective, making me especially adept at tackling complex challenges and ensuring accuracy and efficiency in my work. Now, I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects and continue growing as a developer.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to connect!</p>

                <h3>Project 1 - Weather App</h3>
                <p>A responsive web application that displays real-time weather data for any city. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches live weather information from an external weather API. It features a sleek, user-friendly interface that shows temperature, weather conditions, and location-specific details. This project showcases my ability to work with APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/AJAX), and build intuitive front-end experiences.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>A browser-based application that converts written text into spoken words using the Web Speech API. Users can enter any text and choose from a variety of languages and voices via a dropdown menu, enabling multilingual text-to-speech conversion. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project highlights my skills in working with browser APIs and creating interactive, accessible user interfaces.</p>
